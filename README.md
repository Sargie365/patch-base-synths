# Patch Base Synths

A repository of technical information about synthesizers that Patch Base supports, or will support.

If you'd like to contribute information to this repo, please find the synth(s) that you're interested in helping with, and see if they are complete yet or not. If not, shoot me an email first just in case someone is already working on the synth you're considering (so as not to repeat work between people).
