[Nova Owner's Manual](https://fael-downloads-prod.focusrite.com/customer/prod/s3fs-public/novation/downloads/4201/english103.pdf)

The manual lists CC's and NRPN's for all(?) of the Program parameters. But there doesn't seem to be any documentation of how to read a patch dump, or a bank, or how to request these from the synth.
